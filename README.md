# ESPerPass
A 3DS HomePass implementation for the ESP8266 programmable WiFi chip.
Inspired by [this reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/3DS/comments/80k0qb/homepass_for_cheap_using_an_esp8266/)
and largely based on the great work done by [Martin Ger's ESP WiFi Repeater](https://github.com/martin-ger/esp_wifi_repeater).

## Instructions (need improvement)
1. Flash firmware.
2. Connect ESP8266 to USB and connect with terminal program.
3. Power cycle ESP8266.
3. Follow instructions in terminal program.

## TODO
* Implement firewall rules to restrict connections to official servers.
* Implement mac address list management through console.
